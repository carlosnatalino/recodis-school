# Structural methods to enhance the resilience of content delivery services to link cut attacks

The code available in this reporitory was presented at the training school of CA15127-RECODIS on Design of Disaster-resilient Communication Networks, hosted in Brussels, Dec. 10-11, 2019.

The course was designed by Marija Furdek and Amaro de Sousa. The code was developed by Carlos Natalino and Igor M. de Ara√∫jo.

The code in this repository works with Python 3.6.
The code can use either [LPSOLVE](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/) or IBM CPLEX.
The LP files generated using CPLEX can be also used with Gurobi.

## Content in this repository

- File exploring several metrics of the topologies [here](./explore-topologies.ipynb).
- File containing the ACA examples used in the RECODIS school [here](./aca.ipynb).
- File containing the CLSD examples using predefined replica placement [here](./clsd.ipynb).
- File containing the RPP and CLSD examples [here](./rpp-clsd.ipynb).
- Topology description of two topologies:

- A Dockerfile for the creation of a container using LPSOLVE and Python to run the examples.

## If you want to use a docker container

*Note that you may need superuser permissions to run docker commands in your computer.*

1. Create and start the container with name `school`:

```
docker build --rm -t school .
```


2. Run the docker container:
```
docker run --name school school
```

## If you have Python, Jupyter and LPSOLVE (or IBM CPLEX) in your computer

1. Download the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/carlosnatalino/recodis-school.git
```

2. Run jupyter:
```
cd recodis-school
jupyter lab
```
